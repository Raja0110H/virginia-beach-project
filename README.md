This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for showcasing school information using a map visualization with polygons.
By implementing this functionality, users will be able to access a list of schools, view their locations on a map, and obtain relevant information about each school by hovering over its corresponding polygon.

Retrieving the School List:
The first step of our project involves gathering a comprehensive list of schools.
This list will include relevant information such as school names, addresses, and other pertinent details that will enhance the user experience.

Map Visualization with Polygons:
To visualize the schools on a map, we will utilize polygons. Each polygon will represent the geographical area of a specific school. 
By using this visual representation, users can easily identify the boundaries of each school's location and understand its spatial context.

Hover Information:
When users hover over a specific polygon on the map, our project will provide them with detailed information about the corresponding school.
This information may include any relevant data that will help users make informed decisions or gain a better understanding of the schools in their vicinity.

TO GET STARTED:

Install node modules:
### `npm install`

To start the project run:
